# ToDoApp
Hi everyone!
I have created a todo application using the Django Framework and the Python programming language.

I decided to learn Django in order to improve myself in the web field, to express my projects in the field of machine learning and natural language processing better with the web project. MVT(Model View Template) structure is used in Django.

I used the SQLite database to store my data.

If I need to briefly mention my application, it is a classic todo application. You write down the things you plan to do. If you do these, you click on the "Is Finished" button and in this way it draws on your todo. If you want, you can update, delete or view their content.
